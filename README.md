# SImple-Linear-Regression
When the relationship has a linear (or straight-line) pattern, the correlation provides a numerical measure of the strength and direction of the relationship. Finding an equation for the straight line that best describes that pattern describes regression. That equation predicts the value of the response variable from the value of the explanatory variable. The straight line that best describes the linear pattern is called the regression line. The equation of the regression line predicts the value for the response variable y from the explanatory variable x. The equation for the regression line has the form: y =a+bx Where a denotes the y-intercept, and b denotes the slope. The simple linear regression line describes the nature of the relationship between the dependent variable y and the independent variable x. The slope of the line reflects the degree to which the variable y changes linearly as a function of changes in the variable x. The sign of the slope indicates whether the relationship between x and y is positive or negative. A positive slope indicates that both variables change in the same direction; and a negative slope indicates that x and y changes in opposite directions. If there is no linear relationship between x and y, then the regression line will be flat (zero slope).
